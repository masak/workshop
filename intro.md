Hi.

My name is Carl Mäsak. Online I'm more used to going by my nickname, `masak`.
I made this workshop. Nice to meet you.

When I give courses to enterprise customers, I make sure to introduce myself
properly. I say something like this:

> As many people my age, I started out humbly with BASIC. Then I migrated up
> via various languages, and I did a bunch of Java and Perl at university.
> Nowadays I teach a number of programming languages, and I also spend a
> significant part of my time as a core member of the Perl 6 community,
> implementing things like grammar engines and compilers, and also contributing
> to the language design.

See, in a corporate setting, it's all about credentials. If I pull off the
introduction in the right way, convincing the participants that I have the
résumé required to temporarily install myself above them in the hierarchy, the
whole course will provide a better taste experience for them. They feel they're
getting value for their money. Even though probably they didn't pay; their boss
did. Or the departmental budget.

But you didn't pay to participate in this workshop. I don't expect to keep you
here by bragging. I don't even feel the need to justify my role as instructor
to this crowd. If I'd show anything as my credentials, it'd be things that
sound like *weaknesses*: every day, I realize how I keep needing to learn and
reevaluate and evolve, how I find that my wetware really isn't optimized for
logic and math and keeps swapping out important information, or suffering from
predictable biases.

Most days, I suck at programming.

Some days, I am, if I may say so myself, rather decent.

If this course has a theme, that theme is about applying various sorts of
discipline, to make the sucky programming days suck less, and to make the
decent days more decent.

Now let's turn to you. I'll probably ask people to introduce themselves
on-channel. Here are my expectations &mdash; not many &mdash; on you:

* Spend time on the workshop material that interests you.
* If an exercise or topic really works for you, do more of it. Go above and
  beyond.
* If an exercise or topic doesn't work for you, do something about it.
  Make noise on the channel to attract explanations. Or move on and try
  something else. Suggest new things to try.
* Generally, if you get stuck in any way, take action. People will eagerly
  swoop in and advise you or point you in the right direction. You're
  eligible for infinite help on all tasks. If you don't ask for help, others
  will not know to help you.
* It's OK to submit partial solutions for review and discussion.
* Be curious. Learn stuff. When in doubt, experiment and observe. Have fun!

I also tend to say to the corporate participants, by way of introducing myself:

> No matter what kind of programming we do for a living, whether you're selling
> socks online, controlling robot arms in a factory, or sending automated motor
> vehicles to Mars, the main activity is fundamentally awesome: we're *putting
> behavior into inert matter*. Programming is the closest thing we have to magic
> in the read world.

Because, you know, those three are the only sub-professions of programmer there
are: robot arm coder, Mars rover technician, and sock vendor. `:-)`

But really, I think programming is *awesome*. Like really, I'm getting *paid*
to be a code whisperer? Woot!

It's a very young discipline, and we have relatively little idea of what we're
doing. Which makes it all the more important to cling to the little pieces of
knowledge that we have about our craft, in order to be able to use our
programming abilities to make a better world.

Which brings us directly to the advertised theme. I believe being able to write
helpful, efficient, and functioning code is directly connected to writing
simple, readable and elegant code. As a guild, we have some of the answers
already; let's learn them and practice them and discuss them.

Let's begin. *For science!*
