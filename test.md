Let's say I wanted to write a function that would repeat a string up to a given
length. Where would I start? I would probably start with a simple test, something
setting up an expectation for the function:

    is repeat("again", 20), "againagainagainagain";

So I'm testing that when I pass the 5-character string `"again"`, along with
the desired length 20, I get a 20-character string back. (I was tempted to
write `"again" x 4` there instead. Just so you know.)

Then I go ahead and implement the code that makes that pass:

    sub repeat {
        my ($substring, $length) = @_;
        my $repetitions = $length / length $substring;
        return $substring x $repetitions;
    }

And then I would think if there's any situation I'm still not covering. In this
case, yes, there is: I'm only testing when a (5-char) substring fits exactly a
whole number of times into the expected length (20 characters). What about the
case where it doesn't?

So I write a new test:

    is repeat("bla", 10), "blablablab";

And I can observe the test fail:

    1..2
    ok 1
    not ok 2
    #   Failed test at repeat line 10.
    #          got: 'blablabla'
    #     expected: 'blablablab'
    # Looks like you failed 1 test of 2.

So now I know what I have to go back and fix. In this case, I just change the
end of my subroutine, so that it looks like this instead:

    sub repeat {
        my ($substring, $length) = @_;
        my $repetitions = $length / length $substring;
        my $rest = substr($substring, 0, $length % length $substring);
        return $substring x $repetitions . $rest;
    }

And now my tests pass:

    1..2
    ok 1
    ok 2

I like tests. They tend to guide development, point out bugs early, ease
debugging, and form a practical means of communication between developers.
To me, tests are not "an extra thing". They are an important 50% of your
program; the part that makes sure your expectations are in sync with your
implementation.

Because tests are the best way I know to communicate requirements, the form a
part of most exercises.

Seriously, if I could give people one piece of advice for how to better
themselves as programmers, it's to boost up their unit testing skills. It pays
off amazingly.

If you're completely new to testing, reading up on
[`Test::More`](https://metacpan.org/module/Test::More) might be a good idea.
The corresponding module for Perl 6 is just called `Test`, but the subroutines
are the same.
