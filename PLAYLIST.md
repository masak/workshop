    [
        { song => "Follow Me Back Into The Sun", duration => "4:18" },
        { song => "The City And The River",      duration => "4:02" },
        { song => "Stay Over",                   duration => "3:17" },
        { song => "Stranger Keeper",             duration => "3:30" },
        { song => "You're Not Listening",        duration => "4:11" },
    ]

The total playing time of all these songs is 19 minutes and 18 seconds.
