Write a program that prints out "Just another Perl hacker". The line can have
an optional comma at the end.

It's up to you whether to do it the obvious way, or to pour your crativity into
it and do it in a way the rest of us wouldn't expect.

Check out the [Wikipedia
article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_another_Perl_hacker) if you want.
Or this [archive of JAPHs](http://www.cpan.org/misc/japh).
