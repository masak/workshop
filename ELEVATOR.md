Implement an elevator, given this surrounding physical environment, and a
simulation of tenants wanting to ride the elevator.

...this is the only exercise I haven't had time to prepare yet. If you get to
it before I have time to fill it in, come talk to me, and I'll give as much
information as I have at the moment. It's a fun one, I promise.

Or just skip to another section. Whatever works for you. :)
