*Kenya Believe It! Tours* want to completely modernize their user-facing tour
booking functionality. They have recruited you to design and implement it.

Your mission, should you decide to accept it, is to design and implement
business logic to allow customers (prospective tourists) to explore the
available tours, *book* a given tour on a given date, to *pay* online for this
tour, and to *cancel* their bookings.

Try to get a good feel for the **nouns** and the **verbs** you use in the
domain.

In your design, explore edge cases: what happens if a customer tries to pay for
a tour twice? Can tours exceed capacity? Should customers who cancel be
refunded?

For the purpose of this exercise, the implementation can be something as simple
as a text menu of choices, with a few tours already added to the system.

Now step back and think about what can be done to make this system less anemic
and less anmesiac. For example, what's the first action a customer is likely to
want to take? When actions fail, can we somehow lead them in the right
direction? When some actions succeed, is there a likely next action?
