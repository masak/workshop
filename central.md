You now have the choice to branch out into one of three tracks.

* The green track takes you down a processing route. The focus here is on
  taking in input, and doing stuff with it.

* The orange track takes you down a data route. The focus here is on shaping
  and understand data in better ways, to further our reach by making us
  treat data more flexibly.

* The light blue track takes you down an object route. The focus here is
  on using, combining, and re-using code, serving not just ourselves but
  others, too.

I honestly have no idea what you will choose. Pick something that seems to suit
you. You're free to come back here at any time and choose again.
